# Important notes on the program

## Tuning parameters
- Number of states
- Number of emissions
- Maximum number of observations kept by the classifier
- Learning precision: threshold that determines when the update is accurate
enough to stop updating the model, i.e. 
current logP(observations) - previous logP(observations) < Learning precision --> STOP
- Default probability for emission that is never observed: when learning and updating B, we may
have an emission that we never encountered. To not have 0 in the correspondent column of B,
we add one to the numerator
