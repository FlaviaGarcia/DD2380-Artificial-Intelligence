In this course two labs were done in Java:
- A1: Hidden Markov Models (HMM) were used to developed the DuckHunt game. We needed to predict the next move of the bird to shoot it. Also the specie of the bird had to be predicted.
- A2: Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning was used to solve an N-dimension tic-tac-toe and checkers game. Hash tables were also used in order to optimize the performance of the algorithm.
